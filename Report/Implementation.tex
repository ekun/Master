\chapter{Implementation}
In many cases, you will not be able to realize the full design. Often the implementation is only a demonstrator of ideas. 
It is therefore important that you focus on the most important aspects of your system (depending on research questions). 
In the report you have to justify the choices that are done.

\subsection{Server}
Here we will give an overview on how the server is implemented, since the application is implemented with a framework called Grails(which you can read about below).

\subsubsection{Grails}
Grails is an open source web application framework which uses the programming language Groovy(which is based on Java). When Grails was developed, it's developers aimed to re-use proven technologies such as Hibernate and Spring 

\subsubsection{Github API}
http://developer.github.com/v3/
For gathering data from Github, this data is transfered as JSON(JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweigh data interchange language

\subsubsection{Database}
% Include domain diagram

% explain everything
This is how the database is designed and why perhaps?
\subsubsubsection{Reflection}
Notes
How notes are stored

Workshop <-- WorkshopQuestions
how workshop data is stored and workshop questions etc

\subsubsubsection{Github data}
Github data is stored localy to enhance performance and ease up on the requirement for github-connection.

Milestones:
The milestone feature in Github feature the possibility of setting up the different deliveries, iterations etc.

Commits:
The tool can retrieve all commits done by a user, or even all commits for a given project/repository. This includes commit comments, timestamps and other relevant data. This can be used together with milestones to see commit activity, commit spikes and such. We can also through comments etc. see if there were any specific problems during a certain period. This will be tightly integrated with the milestones set up in the github project. 

Tags/Labels:
Git(the version control system which Github is based on) also allows tagging specific points in history with labels. Since this is different from the tagging we had in mind we need to provide our own tagging methods to produce tagclouds. Our approach is based on the way twitter uses tagging(hashtags), but there might be useful to show git specific tags as well.

Repositories
A projects artifact base is stored as repositories on Github. We can extract this data.

\subsubsubsection{User}
Show what data is stored about a user and explain the fields.
