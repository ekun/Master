\chapter{Peaceful Banana Application}
\label{peacefulBananaApplication}
Peaceful Banana integrates with Github, collecting the most relevant data for reflection use. In order to describe the PeacefulBanana tool, an introduction of Github is required.\\

\section{Github}
\subsection{Repositories}
\subsection{Commits}
\subsection{Milestones and Issues}
\begin{quote}
\em GitHub Issues can be assigned to a user to make it easy to know who's working on what, or which issues you need to tackle next.
\end{quote}
Every GitHub repository has an issue tracker, that allows users to track bugs and focus on features. Milestones and issues help manage large projects, where issues especially makes for a great TODO list, similar to a product backlog. Only {\bf collaborators} can create and view issues on private repositories. On public repositories anyone can create and view issues. 
\begin{itemize}
\item GitHub issues can be assigned to a user, which makes it easy to know who's working on what, or which issues should be handled next. Milestones are a good way of helping team members to work towards a goal. A team can set a due date, name a milestone and then start assigning issues to that milestone. An example of a Milestone could be a due date of a project demo or delivery. Any number of issues can then be assigned to this milestone, and thus be connected to it. 
\item Issues know all about commits. Github enables referencing and closing issues with Commit Messages. By using a few simple keywords you can close an issue right from a commit message, or just leave a note on the issue.The syntax to do this is as follows: To close issue \#35 , a commit message containing 'closes \#35' , will close issue number 35 when pushed to github. Other keywords are: close, closes, closed, fixes, fixed. \\
To leave a note on issues can be done by simply mentioning the issue number without any keywords in a commit message. F.ex "This commit references \#35". Anyone with write access to a repository may close an issue or leave a note.
\end{itemize}

\section{What is PeacefulBanana?}
The prototype will be a tool supporting reflection. The tool will integrate with Github, which features version-tracking support and several useful tools for version control. The tool will not provide the same possibilities already found on Github, but integrate with it using the existing data and provide an additional layer of features specific for aiding reflection for the duration of an agile project.

\section{What does it do?}
* Provide an overview of the project
* When the team closed what issue
* Which milestones where closed when
* What issues where connected to which milestone
* Did the team meet its milestone deadlines.
* Who did what

* Reflectiv sessions
	* What did we do well in milestone x
	* What could have been done differently when solving issue nr x
	* Why didn't we meet our deadline on milestone x
	+ Quick summaries

* Quick 5-min reflection
	* Why did I do that yesterday
	* What did we do well last sprint
	* Identify top two factors the team can improve


\section{Main goal}
Is to create a reflection to for software development teams with multiple representation of data. % Short story

\section{Functionality}

Reflection directed functionality:
\begin{itemize}
\item Collecting data - How a user can retrieve data and annotate it. 
\item Sharing data - How users can work together in groups to collaborate with data. 
\item Reflection triggers - Functionality developed specifically for helping users reflect on their work.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Authentication}
The application will feature an independent authentication, with the possibility of getting access to data from Github by using OAUTH2 tokens. When the user first uses the tool, he will be asked to authenticate with Githubs authentication page asking the user to log in and authorize the PeacefulBanana tool. When this is done the tool receives a token it can use on behalf of the user to retrieve data from Github. The token is stored in a secure database and linked with the user logged in at the time. 

\subsection{Reflection triggers}
\paragraph{Scaffolded notes}\mbox{}\\
Tool should provide the ability to take notes but in a scaffolded way. It should not be possible to make too general notes. The tool will provide this through coupling with certain elements in the milestones. This will make notes connected to a certain commit or event in the project trajectory. 

\paragraph{Tagclouds}\mbox{}\\
Tagclouds

\paragraph{Sharing of data}\mbox{}\\
What data should be shared and how should the sharing be done in order to promote reflection? What functions should the tool provide to the user in addition to the github data that can be used for reflection?

\paragraph{Mood graphs}\mbox{}\\
A user can connect his mood to data. 
User will have the option to share mood-data, creating a shared average mood of the project, a milestone or even on a single commit, giving an indication of how the work is perceived by the other group members.
