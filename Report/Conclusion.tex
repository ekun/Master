\section{Summary}
Summary of results. At this point results should be discussed also in
relation to research questions.

\section{Discussion on our own work}
Discussion, with a critical reflection on the work that has been presented,
pointing out strengths and weaknesses; e.g. how well have the research questions been answered, limitations in the research methods, â€¦
The primary work done for this thesis was the development of the PeacefulBanana application. Developing PeacefulBanana challenged us to learn about developing applications for the web, and a large variety of different devices and platforms. We also got to explore web frameworks for building web-applications, specifically the Grails framework and the domain of responsive web design. \\
Working together on this thesis and application has been both fun and exciting, and has also given us valuable experience and knowledge we will benefit from in our future work as software developers.

We first created our scenarios with evaluating the tool on software development teams in the IT2901 course at NTNU. Unfortunately the groups were very busy, and was not able to use the tool enough for us to conclude on the data gathered. Therefore we conducted a focus group with such a development team, where we gained valuable information on why they didn't use the tool as often, and also how they felt about the tool \emph{if they had used it}. As it turned out, our two scenarios functioned well in this setting, although they were first intended for evaluation over a longer period of time. The main reason for the group not using the tool, was simply that they were very busy and adopted the tool at a late stage in the project course. Feedback from the focus group was that if introduced with the tool from the beginning it would have been easier to remember to use it, as it would be part of their routine. 


\section{Future Work}
As the interview with the focus group discovered there were several minor improvements both in how certain functions are implemented, but also in how the feature itself is designed visually. 

Technically we would like the tool to have a tighter integration with the version-control-system so that the synchronization itself will go automatically.

As the focus group helped us discover that the daily summary should hold more information, cause you can not really derive what you have done the last 24 hours, and the feature it self could be improved so that the user can edit the note through out the day. However we feel that this could interfere with the reflection level you would achieve with the solution we have created since noting a lot as things occur is not reflecting. They also felt like there was missing a field which they could record completely what they had done that day. It is clear that the daily summary needs to be improved, the fact that it does not provide the user with what they feel is enough data. We feel that an improvement of the current solution and the solution described above. By letting the user note what they have done continuously and answer the reflection specific questions only at the end of the day, the user could note all day long and reconstruct their day more easily and still reflect on a daily basis.

Regarding tag clouds it was discovered that it was hard to find the same tags in the team vs my tag cloud, because the tags is placed randomly and with a random color in both clouds. So we would place tags in the same region and with the same color so it would be  easier to see the relationship between the tag clouds.
