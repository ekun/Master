\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Summary}
Summary of results. At this point results should be discussed also in
relation to research questions.

\section{Discussion on our own work}
Discussion, with a critical reflection on the work that has been presented,
pointing out strengths and weaknesses; e.g. how well have the research questions been answered, limitations in the research methods, â€¦

\section{Future Work}
As the interview with the focus group discovered there were several minor improvements both in how certain functions are implemented, but also in how the feature itself is designed visually. 

Technically we would like the tool to have a tighter integration with the version-control-system so that the synchronization itself will go automatically.
