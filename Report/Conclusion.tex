\section{Summary}
Summary of results. At this point results should be discussed also in
relation to research questions.

\section{Discussion on our own work}
Discussion, with a critical reflection on the work that has been presented,
pointing out strengths and weaknesses; e.g. how well have the research questions been answered, limitations in the research methods, â€¦

\section{Future Work}
As the interview with the focus group discovered there were several minor improvements both in how certain functions are implemented, but also in how the feature itself is designed visually. 

Regarding tag clouds it was discovered that it was hard to find the same tags in the team vs my tag cloud, because the tags is placed randomly and with a random color in both clouds. So we would place tags in the same region and with the same color so it would be  easier to see the relationship between the tag clouds.

When displaying the summary for the last 24 hours it was noted that the summary could display more information,

Technically we would like the tool to have a tighter integration with the version-control-system so that the synchronization itself will go automatically.
