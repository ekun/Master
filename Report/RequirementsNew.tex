\chapter{Requirements}
\label{cha:funcreq}
In this chapter both functional and non-functional requirements the application should meet, in order to better support elaboration and implementation of the final application. 
\section{Functional Requirement}
The requirements detailed in this chapter are prioritized according to how important they are for the implementation, with a three step scale. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{H}]{High-priority requirements must be met by the application.} 
    \item[\textbf{M}]{Medium-priority requirements should be met by the application, but omission will severely limit the application.}
    \item[\textbf{L}]{Low-priority requirements is not vital to the application, but should be met if all high and medium requirements are met.}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}

For this thesis, a three step scale provides us with adequate data for decisions without sacrificing too much fidelity.
In addition to prioritizing the requirements based on importance, the requirements will also be prioritized according to how hard and time consuming they are to implement. These priorities will use the H-M-L scale as described below. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{H}]{High is something that will take more than 10 hours to implement.}
    \item[\textbf{M}]{Medium is something that will take between 5 and 10 hours to implement.}
    \item[\textbf{L}]{Low is something that will take less than 5 hours to implement.}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}
Annotating requirements with both importance and difficulty priorities provides a a way to perform a \emph{cost/benefit} analysis for each of the requirements. A cost/benefit analysis is a way of weighing the total value of benefits against the costs of implementing them\cite{cellini2010cost}.
\begin{equation}
Net Benefits = Total Benefits - Total Cost
\end{equation}
A requirement that is hard to implement fully, but is of little importance to the project as a whole could be dropped in benefit for a more important one (or a less difficult one), if time and/or costs involved are deemed to be to large.
