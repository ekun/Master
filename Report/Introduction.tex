\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis presents a design-science project where the goal was to design a web-application tool as a support for learning and reflection in agile project development teams. The tool was given the name \emph{PeacefulBanana} and the name has since remained unchanged. The purpose of the tool is to make collection of experiences easier during a project development process, and enhance learning outcomes from reflection sessions. 

The tool collects data from the development process and presents them to the users in a tailored way. Users can annotate these data with their own experiences, including connecting feelings and emotions to these experiences. The application presents these data and experiences for use in both individual and collaborative reflection settings. The challenge will be to collect, annotate and present the data in a way that helps the user understand what they have experienced and learn from these experiences. That is helping them reflect on the experiences made and learn from them. Boud et.al\citep{boudreflection1985} presents that; 
\begin{quote}
\emph{Reflection is a process where the experience is revisited, feelings are re-attended and the experience is re-evaluated}
\end{quote}
This means that it is important to tailor the reflection process in order to support and achieve learning from experiences. Using technology to collect data and experiences from everyday work, and the potential for using this to support reflection has been shown to be growing \citep{li2011understanding}. In this thesis we utilize technology for promoting reflection, by trying to capture everyday data related to work experiences, make them available for reflection and store them for later use. The quality of data collected will have an impact on how easy it is for users to revisit the experience and reflect upon it. By using technology we hope to make the challenge of capturing the experience with it's ideas and feelings to support the reflective process easier to overcome. 

\section{Context \& Domain}
For many years now, agile methods in software development have been widely used in software development teams. Agile methodologies are software development methods that is based on iterative and incremental development. This means that requirements and solutions are dynamic and comes as a result of collaboration between self-organizing teams. Agile methods focuses on adaptive planning, iterative development and encourages teams to respond to changes in a flexible way. 

The agile manifesto presents a principle which states that an agile team should regularly reflect on how to become more effective, and tune its behavior accordingly\citep{Beck2001}. Continuously improving through introspection is a vital part of agile methods and is applied i.e. retrospectives\citep{Beck1999, Derby2006, Maham2008}. Cockburn impose that a vital part of agile practice should be conducting regular retrospective workshops aimed at reflection and process tune-up\citep{Cockburn2006}. Agile methods focus on continuous iterations repeating the same development steps, and thus progressing. Retrospectives in agile development processes are most often performed after each iteration. This is done by gathering the team and reflecting on their way of working, so that improvements for the next iteration can be identified \citep{Derby2006, Drury2011}. This enables agile self-governing teams to react quickly to changes, and make modifications accordingly\citep{Drury2011}. Retrospectives could also support communication and interaction within the team, which is important for agile development. 
 
There are however shortcomings of applying retrospectives in agile teams. Agile teams tend to focus primarily on short-term issues that were identified for a single iteration, and not on long-term strategic issues\citep{Drury2011}. Reflection on work related experiences enables users to reflect and derive conclusions from the reflection \citep{Korthagen_Vasalos_2005}. This turns experiences into knowledge that can be applied to the everyday challenges of work and also creates an individual aspect, where the reflection on previous work can be applied to future work challenges. In addition to this individual aspect, reflection has been shown to have strong social aspects, and is often accomplished collaboratively between users in such agile teams \citep{HÃ¸yrup_2004}. Therefore a challenge will be to easily allow users to identify their common tasks and shared work experiences. In software development projects in the industry, it is often a challenge for teams to prioritize retrospectives, as there is other work that is seen as more important \citep{kasi2008post}. For students, revisiting experiences and reflecting on these is often seen as unnecessary and in the way of other tasks, i.e. writing code, testing or documentation. Another challenge is collecting data of sufficient quality to support this reflection, and also how to share this data, experiences and reflection with the rest of the team.  

In this thesis we developed a tool in order to address the challenges of collecting data of sufficient quality to support reflection and how to share these data and experiences in order for users to revisit and reflect upon them. We wish to allow teams to not only reflect on experiences for the last iteration only, but also allow users to go back in time several iterations, in order to identify long-term issues and trends within the team. The tool is aimed at supporting reflection by scaffolding the collection of relevant project artifacts, and prompting users to annotate these artifacts with their experiences and feelings. The tool is designed and developed for software development projects using an agile development process, and will be evaluated with a usability study, a focus group consisting of software developers and also an expert in the field of agile methodologies. 

\subsection{Core Concepts}
In this section we will briefly introduce some concepts which the application developed for this thesis builds upon.
\subsubsection{Learning from experience}
According to David Kolb\citep{KolbModel} for a learning experience to occur there must exists certain abilities in the learner. First the learner must be willing to actively be involved in the experience Secondly the learner must be able to reflect on the experience and third, the learner must possess and be able to use analytical skills to conceptualize the experience. Finally the learner must have skills for decision making and problem solving to be able to create new knowledge outcomes based on the experience.

\subsubsection{Software development}
Software developers generate a lot of data when developing software, when committing data to version control systems or closing tasks and issues in a project management tool. During an agile development cycle, tasks is distributed among the developers and they make decisions either individually or collaboratively. Normally this data is never revisited, but they contain vital information on choices the developers make daily. It is important to make collection of information a part of developers normal day-to-day activities , as can be based on the model from \citep{Krogstie2009}.

\subsubsection{Version-control systems}
Version-control systems is the management of changes to documents, source files or other collections of information. These artifacts are usually identified by a 'revision'\footnote{An unique identifier normally a number or string.}, when creating a revision a lot of data is stored together with the revisioned files. I.e. who committed the data, when it was committed and what files where affected by the change.

In software development, version-control systems can be used for documentation and configuration of a wide variety of files as well as source code. As teams develop software, it is common for developers to create and work on different versions of a system at the same time. Different versions can be tagged in the version-control system, so it is easy to go back in time to a specific state, i.e. looking up the tag for when the last stable version was created.
