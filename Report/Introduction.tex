\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis will present a design project where the goal was to design a web tool for use as support for learning and reflection in agile project development teams. The purpose of the tool is to make collecting of experiences easier during a project development process, and enhance learning outcomes from the reflection sessions. The tool will collect data from the development process and present them to the users in a tailored way. Users can annotate these data with their own experiences, including connecting feelings to these experiences. The web tool will present these data and experiences for use in both individual and collaborative reflection settings. The challenge will be to collect, annotate and present the data in a way that helps the learner to understand what they have experienced and learn from these experiences. That is helping them reflect on the experiences made and learn from them. Boud et.al\cite{boudreflection1985} presents that; \emph{reflection is a process where the experience is revisited, feelings are re-attended and the experience is re-evaluated}. This means that it is important to tailor reflection in order to support and achieve learning.

\section{Motivation and background}
For many years now, agile methods in software development have been widely used in software development teams. Continuously improving through introspection is a vital part of agile methods and is applied in f.ex retrospectives\cite{Beck1999, Derby2006, Maham2008}. Agile methods focus on continuous iterations repeating the same development steps, and thus progressing. Retrospectives in agile development processes are most often performed after each iteration. This is done by gathering the team and reflecting on their way of working, so that improvements for the next iteration can be identified.\cite{Derby2006, Drury2011}. This enables agile self-governing teams to react quickly to changes, and make modifications accordingly\cite{Drury2011}. Retrospectives could also support communication and interaction within the team, which is important for agile development. There are however shortcomings of applying retrospectives in agile teams. Agile teams tend to focus primarily on short-term issues that were identified for a single iteration, and not on long-term strategic issues\cite{Drury2011}. 
In this thesis we will develop a tool in order to address the challenges described above. The tool is aimed at supporting reflection by a scaffolded collection of relevant project artifacts, and prompting users to annotate these artifacts with their experiences and feelings. The tool is designed and developed for software development projects using an agile method, and will be evaluated with an agile team taking a software development course at NTNU. 

\section{Project Context}
The last few years personal digital assistants(PDA) or smart-phones have become a gadget we take for granted and need this for our daily activities.  We take notes and make plans during the day, and share this with our friends and family. Our research will take in consideration different methods on how to display these day-to-day notes and how they may affect learning when collaborating on reflection.

For example when a class is on a school-trip and afterwards you want them to write an essay about what they have learned about the destination. If they had the opportunity to take notes they would the ability to go back and read them and use them as a basis for their essay, but let’s say they had the opportunity to use a tool which gives them the ability to collaborate on the notes and being able to review these notes in multiple ways in order to gain the most of them. Being able to see the notes spread out on a map and pinned to the location where they originated will be of great benefit.

% Multiple representation
Multi-media and multi-representational learning environments are ubiquitous and were so even before the advent of modern educational technology.\cite{Ainsworth1999} By combining three informative ways to display information we give the user an opportunity to view his/her notes or his/her group’s notes in a different way and maybe even put them in perspective. This will help the learners to how to make sense of the information and how to make conscious decision about the use of information. This will give them the opportunity to take a step back and reflect on the information. In order to achieve good results and to further enhance the ability to learn, reflection is needed. These skills are important in both learning with and without technology, but when being supported by technology however, this technology should promote these aspects within learning \cite{Lin1999}.

% Software development
% Trekke inn modellen til birgit? YES!
Software developers generate a lot of data when developing software, when commit data to versioncontrol systems or closing tasks or issues in a project management tool. During a development cycle, tasks is distributed among the developers and they make decisions either individualy or in plural. Normal this set of data is never looked at again, but they contain vital information on choices the developers make at some point in there development. It is important to make collecting of information a part of developers normal day-to-day activities based on the model\cite{Krogstie2009}.

% Reflection
The goal is to offer technology that not only makes information search and collection efficient, but also support reflection in a collaborative session. Through reflection learning can be achieved and users can collaborate on gathering information for experiences and the ability to reflect over experiences by displaying data in different methods this might enhance the reflection ability and letting the user view data in another way.

\section{Intro}
The Introduction is your thesis in a nutshell. 
Again, the organization can vary, but a
standard introduction includes the following sections:
• Motivation: Brief description of the research domain and the problem that one
wants to address. It should tell the reader why working on this project is worth
doing.
• Context: Very brief description of the context in which the project is done. This
is important if you are conducting your work in the context of a wider project.
• Research questions: What are the questions you are answering with your
project? Normally, you specify a main question and related sub-questions.
Remember that at the end you have to demonstrate you have answered to the
stated questions. It is not uncommon that the questions are changed during the
project, but it is important to be as explicit as possible and as early as possible
with research questions since they help you to focus.
\include{ResearchQuestion}
• Research Method: How the research is conducted. In the previous section you
say what you are doing. Here you specify how. The choice of a research method
is strictly connected to the type of questions you want to answer.
\include{ResearchMetod}
• Results: a brief description of the results that you are delivering.
• Outline of the report: reading guide briefly describing what each chapter of the
thesis is about.
