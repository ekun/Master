\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis will present a design-science project where the goal was to design a web tool for use as support for learning and reflection in agile project development teams. The purpose of the tool is to make collecting of experiences easier during a project development process, and enhance learning outcomes from the reflection sessions. The tool will collect data from the development process and present them to the users in a tailored way. Users can annotate these data with their own experiences, including connecting feelings to these experiences. The web tool will present these data and experiences for use in both individual and collaborative reflection settings. The challenge will be to collect, annotate and present the data in a way that helps the learner to understand what they have experienced and learn from these experiences. That is helping them reflect on the experiences made and learn from them. Boud et.al\cite{boudreflection1985} presents that; \emph{reflection is a process where the experience is revisited, feelings are re-attended and the experience is re-evaluated}. This means that it is important to tailor reflection in order to support and achieve learning.

\section{Context and background}
For many years now, agile methods in software development have been widely used in software development teams. The agile manifesto presents a principle which states that an agile team should regularly reflect on how to become more effective, and tune its behavior accordingly\cite{Beck2001}. Continuously improving through introspection is a vital part of agile methods and is applied in f.ex retrospectives\cite{Beck1999, Derby2006, Maham2008}. Cockburn impose that a vital part of agile practice should be conducting regular retrospective workshops aimed at reflection and process tune-up\cite{Cockburn2006}. Agile methods focus on continuous iterations repeating the same development steps, and thus progressing. Retrospectives in agile development processes are most often performed after each iteration. This is done by gathering the team and reflecting on their way of working, so that improvements for the next iteration can be identified.\cite{Derby2006, Drury2011}. This enables agile self-governing teams to react quickly to changes, and make modifications accordingly\cite{Drury2011}. Retrospectives could also support communication and interaction within the team, which is important for agile development. There are however shortcomings of applying retrospectives in agile teams. Agile teams tend to focus primarily on short-term issues that were identified for a single iteration, and not on long-term strategic issues\cite{Drury2011}. 
In this thesis we will develop a tool in order to address the challenges described above. The tool is aimed at supporting reflection by a scaffolded collection of relevant project artifacts, and prompting users to annotate these artifacts with their experiences and feelings. The tool is designed and developed for software development projects using an agile method, and will be evaluated with an agile team taking a software development course at NTNU. 

% Multiple representation
Multi-media and multi-representational learning environments are ubiquitous and were so even before the advent of modern educational technology.\cite{Ainsworth1999} By combining three informative ways to display information we give the user an opportunity to view his/her notes or his/her group’s notes in a different way and maybe even put them in perspective. This will help the learners to how to make sense of the information and how to make conscious decision about the use of information. This will give them the opportunity to take a step back and reflect on the information. In order to achieve good results and to further enhance the ability to learn, reflection is needed. These skills are important in both learning with and without technology, but when being supported by technology however, this technology should promote these aspects within learning \cite{Lin1999}.

% Software development
% Trekke inn modellen til birgit? YES!
Software developers generate a lot of data when developing software, when commit data to versioncontrol systems or closing tasks or issues in a project management tool. During a development cycle, tasks is distributed among the developers and they make decisions either individualy or in plural. Normal this set of data is never looked at again, but they contain vital information on choices the developers make at some point in there development. It is important to make collecting of information a part of developers normal day-to-day activities based on the model\cite{Krogstie2009}.

% Reflection
The goal is to offer technology that not only makes information search and collection efficient, but also support reflection in a collaborative session. Through reflection learning can be achieved and users can collaborate on gathering information for experiences and the ability to reflect over experiences by displaying data in different methods this might enhance the reflection ability and letting the user view data in another way.
