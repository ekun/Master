abstract = {Agile development approaches were developed because people were looking for a way to rapidly produce cost effective, working software that could be used in a matter of weeks rather than months. There are now many flavours of high-speed, low documentation software delivery approaches that are called Agile. However, many organisations already have significant investment in other methods that are mature, reliable, trusted and cost effective. Many attempts at Agile implementation fail to recognise that there is anything else present in the landscape, and that leads to dysfunctional and non-productive programmes.},

abstract = {Many Agile proponents encourage reflection as part of the feedback/learning cycle. When we began using Agile practices, including reflection, I discovered that our organizations norms and beliefs tended to discount the value of regular reflection meetings. Many engineers wanted to avoid anything that might be seen as touchy- feely. Our initial attempts at holding regular reflection meetings for agile teams had mixed results. Some reflections turned into gripe sessions where a lot of venting occurred but nothing changed. Other reflections were short and a little too sweet team members said little and no learning occurred. This paper describes some of our efforts helping teams improve their reflection meetings and relates some of the positive results in my organization as a result of regular reflection. It also discusses techniques for overcoming initial reluctance to take time out to reflect, keeping reflection meetings interesting, and taking reflection to a deeper level.},

abstract = {Distribution of software development is becoming more and more common in order to save the production cost and reduce the time to market. Large geographical distance, different time zones and cultural differences in distributed software development (DSD) leads to weak communication which adversely affects the project. Using agile practices for distributed development is also gaining momentum in various organizations to increase the quality and performance of the project. This paper explores the intersection of these two significant trends for software development i.e. DSD and agile. We discuss the challenges faced by geographically distributed agile teams and proven practices to address these issues, which will help in building a successful distributed team.},
