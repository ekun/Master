This chapter features the PeacefulBanana quick start guide, given to the students for our evaluation. \\
Peaceful Banana is a tool aimed towards aiding reflection in teams. It integrates with GitHub, collects the most relevant project artifacts and scaffolds these in order to trigger and promote reflection in your team.
See you and your co-workers latest activity and use tag-cloud or statistics to create your daily reflection notes. PeacefulBanana allows you to choose what to share, and what to keep private! Reflect on your individual work by revisiting reflection notes, or reflect on your team's activity through reflection workshops and much more.

% Denne delen bør ikke være for lang, men vise kort med screenshots hva som skjer hvor og mulighetene. Denne bør gjøres snarest og minst før evalueringen. 
% Se evt timeline mastern, der har de noe lignende som kan brukes som inspirasjon =)

\section{Getting started}
In order to use the Peaceful Banana application you need access to a device with an up-to-date internet browser, such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Opera or Internet Explorer(version 7 and up). Other browsers present on tablets and smartphones may also work, but we suggest using one of the mentioned here. 
In order to access the web-application, you need to open your browser and access this url: \url{http://vm-6121.idi.ntnu.no:8080/PeacefulBanana/} . Here you will be greeted by our welcome screen\\

After filling in your registration details, you will receive an email containing a confirmation link. By clicking this link you will automatically be logged in to PeacefulBanana and redirected to GitHub for authorization. 
In order for PeacefulBanana to collect necessary data from GitHub, you will need to authorize our application, this will look something like this:
