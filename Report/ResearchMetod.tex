\section{Research Method}
\subsubsection{Design as an artifact}
By definition, the result of design-science research in Information Science is:
\begin{quote}
\emph{A purposeful IT artifact created to address an important organizational problem. It must be described effectively, enabling its implementation and application in an appropriate domain.} \citep{Esearch2004}
\end{quote}
Markus et al.\citep{markusetal} identified that a developed artifact is only significant if there is questions like: Can it be constructed, can it perform appropriately and is the result important to the information science community. 
We will create a proof of concept prototype tool for promoting experienced-based learning from reflection based on project artifacts collected from version-control systems. Our goal was to create a tool that can discover new capabilities in the domain of reflection and experience-based learning, as well as support the existing capabilities in an efficient way. Evaluating the tool in \emph{real use} situations is necessary in order to discover if the artifact can enhance the reflection process as it is today.

\subsubsection{Research Guidelines}
The \emph{Design-Science Research Guidelines} presented in \citep{Esearch2004} will serve as the basis of this design-science research. The guidelines were created in order to assist researchers to understand the necessary requirements for effective design-science research. 

\subsection{Design as a research process}
Development of the application was done in development cycles, inspired be the regulative cycle presented by Wieringa \citep{wieringa}, and is shown in Figure ~\ref{regulativecycle}. 
The early parts of the development process was used to develop ideas and basic mock-ups of the application and its design. The initial prototype design was based heavily on the first concept and mock-ups created, in addition to recurring feedback from users and supervisors. Early parts of development resulted in a prototype with functionality for individual reflection use. The next goal was to incorporate teams and support collaborative reflection in the team, building and improving on the basic functionality present in the tool. In the later parts of the development, the focus was the integration of individual reflection notes, into the team collaborative data. This resulted in a tool for both individual and collaborative aspects for reflection and learning. We used the tool ourselves during development, as it would be used in a real world environment. In this way we ensure that all functionality is as expected, and also identify limitations in the design. 

Finally we performed a case study evaluation with computer-science students, and an expert review. Evaluating these separately provide two sets of feedback which we can compare in order to possibly see if any patterns emerge.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{researchmodel} shows the research model used for the development of our prototype from initial concept and ideas, to the final implementation and evaluation. The model depicts how we started the process by reading theory in order to get a better understanding the core concepts of reflection on experiences, and the learning from experiences(See Chapter \ref{chap:background} for the thesis background). We conducted a literature review (Section \ref{sec:literaturereview}) and looked at related work done on computer-supported tools for reflection and learning (Section \ref{sec:relatedwork}). On the basis of theory and previous work done, a problem elaboration was created (Chapter \ref{chap:problemelaboration}). The problem elaboration led us in turn to the process of creating the requirements for the application (Chapter \ref{chap:requirements}). The initial design with concept and mock-ups also helped identify requirements for the application, together with feedback from our supervisor. All implementations were then done conducted using a daily delivery cycle.

\subsection{Daily Delivery Cycle}
\label{sec:dailydeliverycycle}

 \ref{iterationprocess} shows an illustration of our daily delivery cycle. The cycle was inspired by the regulative cycle presented by Wieringa\citep{wieringa}, shown in Figure \ref{regulativecycle}. 
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{iterationprocess}
\caption{The PeacefulBanana daily delivery cycle}
\label{iterationprocess}
\end{figure}

The cycle starts with a set of requirements. These requirements are initially based on user-stories and scenarios. In subsequent iterations of the cycle, the requirements were then updated based on feedback from from experts and users of the application. A task list is then created from the set of requirements, where the highest prioritized requirements was implemented first. This task list acts as a backlog 
\footnote{The backlog is the list of work the developers must address during the current iteration} for the application. On GitHub we created the more general tasks as \emph{Milestones} and the more specific tasks as \emph{issues} connected to these milestones\footnote{GitHub Issues \& Milestones: \url{https://github.com/features/projects/issues}}.\\* Development was conducted primarily using pair-programming\footnote{Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation}, so that we could review each line of code as it was written. Whenever a task has been implemented, the implementation was tested manually in the application, as well as by automatic tests. When a feature was accepted and working as intended, we submitted the code to our project repository on GitHub.
This ensured an iterative approach to development, expanding our application with more and more quality-assured functionality. 

\subsubsection*{Dogfooding}
While developing the application, we continuously used the application ourselves, this is a concept called dogfooding.

Dogfooding is a concept where you 'eat your own dog food', this means that the developers are testing their own product while developing it\citep{dogfooding}. It is normally something larger software development teams are doing as a pre alpha-testing, this will help developers to discover eventual problem-areas early.

\subsection{Evaluation} 
Table 2 , shown in Figure \ref{table2evaluation} from \citep{Esearch2004} will serve as guidelines for evaluation of our prototype.
During evaluation we will be using parts of the evaluation toolbox published by MIRROR\footnote{\url{http://www.mirror-project.eu/showroom-a-publications/downloads/finish/5/67}}. This toolbox is a specification of evaluation methodology and research tooling. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{table2evaluation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Focus group}
Focus groups is a form of qualitative research which can be compared to semi-structured group interviews\citep{rogers2011interaction}. Participants in a group are asked about their opinions and views towards a product or concept based on their background and experiences\citep{krueger2008focus}. The group should consist of six to ten persons, where participants are not inhibited to present their honest opinions and experiences\citep{krueger2008focus}. The discussion is governed by a facilitator which have the task of keeping focus on the discussion in order to get answers to the questions that have been prepared beforehand\citep{krueger2008focus, nielsen1997use}. The facilitator is responsible for keeping the discussion open, uninhibited, non-judgemental and also making sure that all participants are allowed to present their views\citep{powell1996focus}. \\
A focus group usually lasts between 90 and 120 minutes, and is conducted in a neutral place. Limitations of a focus group include that you only get information on what potential users say, and not what they do or if it aligns with the reality\citep{nielsen1997use}. Another limitation is that users often think they need something else than what they really need. Therefore it is important to demonstrate something concrete, where users understand fully what the application is, what it does and what it achieves. 
 
\subsubsection{Observational}
Before and after the user evaluation of the tool, all test-subjects will be given a form with a set of questions to evaluate the application. We will be using core demographic questions, app usage, the most relevant app-specific questions, and also the reflection scale from the toolbox[Appendix \ref{reflectionscale}]. The reflection scale assesses participants' general tendency to reflect and the importance they place on reflection. Using this scale, allows us to see whether using the tool prime people to reflect more. That is: Does the tool increase the users tendency to reflect on experiences, both individually and as a team. Measuring this on users before and after implementation of the tool, allows us to measure the expected increase. \\*
After the evaluation period,  we will include the learning outcomes and the work behavior questions from the evaluation toolbox.

\subsubsection{Analytical}
We will perform a dynamic analysis on the data collected from the application-server and user feedback. During evaluation the application will provide simple usage-patterns on how the users use the application. The usage statistics collected by the application are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Total number of reflection notes
\item Number of reflection notes per team
\item Number of reflection notes per user
\item The average mood, on a scale from 1 - 100.
\item The ratio of shared notes to private notes. 
\end{itemize}
An example of this data can be seen in Figure: \ref{notestatistics}. 
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{notestatistics}
\caption{Reflection note statistics}
\label{notestatistics}
\end{figure}
\\*
We will also gather statistical data regarding the GitHub data present in the application, shown in Figure: \ref{githubstatistics}
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{githubstatistics}
\caption{GitHub statistics}
\label{githubstatistics}
\end{figure}

This will also help us in the analysis of the applications performance as well as its usefulness in the reflection and learning domains.

\subsubsection{Testing}
During development we will continuously test the tool to ensure that the user experience is as expected, as a means of quality assurance.
White Box testing will be executed during development of the application with artificial data to ensure that the function is working properly and as specified. 

\subsubsection{Descriptive}
Evaluation proposal with the students in IT2901 - A project course taken by computer science students on the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). 
Students that accept to evaluate our tool, will have the possibility to use it for two weeks, with daily individual use and as a team after the two week period. This will allow us to measure the usage of our scenarios. 

Requirements: 
The first scenario does not require anything but a GitHub repository and is doable both for single and for multiples in teams.
For scenario 2 we will require a team of at least 3 people in order to collect enough data. 
We have continuously been using and evaluating the tool ourselves, also a fellow student has been using it for a couple of weeks, so we have some additional evaluation
data also.

\subsection{Research Contributions}
The main goal was to create a proof of concept application that may help users reflect on their past experiences, both individually and collaboratively in reflection sessions, by collecting experiences daily, storing and revisiting them at any time. The implementation of the application and the evaluation of it gave us a foundation to answer our research questions, and also identify areas that can go into future research and development in the domain of technology supported reflection and collaboration. 
Future work  and the identified proposed features and improvements can be seen in Section \ref{sec:futurework}

 will provide an increased understanding of how technology can support reflection in software development teams, by collecting and revisiting experiences from everyday work. 

\subsection{Research Rigor}
The application was evaluated through a usability test, an expert review and a focus group consisting of a software development team. By evaluating the application with experts in the relevant fields provides an indication for the usefulness of the application.
