\chapter{PeacefulBanana Database Descriptions}
This part of the appendix will describe a detailed walkthrough of each class in PeacefulBanana. 
\section{User data}
The first section is devoted to show and tell all data related to users, the tables described represents the different data types associated with users. Users are a vital part of the implementation and everything is centered around these users, it is therefore important to store as much relevant data as possible. \\

\subsection*{User}
This table hold data related to each user and only the data which is unique to them.
The password are encrypted with SHA-512 encryption which is a part of SHA-2 a set of encryption hashing functions created by the U.S. National Security Agency in 2002 and is a known not to be reversal.\\

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{| c | X |}
    \hline
    \rowcolor[gray]{0.8}
    \textbf{Field} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    Id & Unique id generated when the user is first created\\ \hline
    UserName & This field stores the users username\\ \hline
   	Password & This field stores the users password as a encrypted string, the password is encrypted with SHA-512 encryption\\ \hline

    \hline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection*{Role}
The different roles that the users can be assigned to. These are hierarchy so that the highest gains access to the subset of this access level. \\

\subsection{GitHub data}
In this section we discuss the storage of data collected from GitHub. When we started development we tested with the data stored at GitHub, so we asked GitHub for the data every time it was needed, this made the application slow so we decided to store GitHub data locally to enhance performance. 

When retrieving data from GitHub we used the provided API as described by their developer-site\footnote{\url{http://developer.github.com/v3/}}, this enabled us to control the sequence of data and when to ask for what type of data. All communication to GitHub servers are asynchronous and while therefore not introduce any performance related issues. 

The following data-types where stored in tables as described below.

\subsection*{Milestones}
Milestones are major goals consisting of several minor goals called issue, with or without a due date. \\
