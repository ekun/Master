\chapter{State of the art}
This chapter provides an overview of the literature. It positions your work with respect to
work already done by others.

Important points to remember in the literature review:
\begin{itemize}
\item be organized around and related directly to the thesis or research question you are developing
\item synthesize results into a summary of what is and is not known
\item identify areas of controversy in the literature
\item formulate questions that need further research
\end{itemize}

Is there any other similar tools already developed?
