\section{Research Question}
We want to research on how to explore the use of multiple representations to support collaborative reflection sessions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item How to support multiple representations for reflection around artifacts to enhance learning?
	\begin{itemize2}
		\item How to support the transitions among different representations?
		\item How to bring together contributions from multiple users, possibly using different conceptualization of the work process? 
		\item How to support cooperation around these representations? 
	\end{itemize2}
\end{itemize}

A small part of this research will be to discovery what screen size is best suited for this type of application. Large amounts of information will be very hard to interpret on a small screen and it will therefore be relevant to see what size is the limit for this kind of application. We donâ€™t see this as a research question, but more as a fact that needs to be taken in to consideration when putting this type of application in to use in day-to-day situations.
