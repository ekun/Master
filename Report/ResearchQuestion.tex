\begin{itemize}
	\item How to support multiple representations for reflection around artifacts to enhance learning?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How to support the transitions among different representations?
		\item How to bring together contributions from multiple users, possibly using different conceptualization of the work process? 
		\item How to support cooperation around these representations? 
	\end{itemize}
