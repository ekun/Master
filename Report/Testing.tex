\chapter{Testing}
\subsection{Testing during development}
During implementation we conducted a series of userinterface reviews, here we asked fellow students to complete a set of tasks and comment on the user interface. 
\subsubsection{User interface}
During the first set of testing it was revealed a set of inconsistencies, mainly regarding where the users could find certain data and where they though it was natural to find them. 
This resulted in a redesign of certain aspects of the application, where data representation was moved after the second series of test subjects confirmed that they where placed unnatural.
