\chapter{Testing}
\subsection{Testing during development}
During implementation we conducted a series of userinterface reviews, here we asked fellow students to complete a set of tasks and comment on the user interface. 

\subsection{System}
While developing the applications all of the developers used the application, this is a concept called dogfooding.

Dogfooding is a concept where you 'eat your own dog food'.

\subsection{User interface}
When most of the functionality was finished a expert review of the user interface was conducted.

Explain how we conducted the test.

During the first set of testing it was revealed a set of inconsistencies, mainly regarding where the users could find certain data and where they though it was natural to find them. 
This resulted in a redesign of certain aspects of the application, where data representation was moved after the second series of test subjects confirmed that they where placed unnatural.
