\section{Focus group}
The application was evaluated with a focus group consisting of 8 NTNU students, working together in a group in the IT2901 bachelor - project. The group were using scrum as their agile project methodology, and have also used it previously in development projects. A group of 8 is fairly big, although larger focus groups are recommended in order to collect more commentaries and details from discussions\citep{morgan1998planning}. Participants in the focus group were familiar with the use of GitHub and were also using GitHub for their project at the time of evaluation. In their project they use retrospectives after each sprint, since they are using scrum. This provides the focus group with participants eager to improve their collaboration in agile teams and to improve reflection, both individually and in teams during retrospective sessions. The focus group was hosted at NTNU, in a private workshop lab. 

The group were given the reflection scale from the MIRROR evaluation toolbox before starting the evaluation. Their answers and relationship to reflection can be seen in table \ref{reflectionscaleresults}.

\end{figure}
In the table above we can see the level of agreement represented by the amount of group members which answered what for each of the questions. The group generally agree with the importance of reflection overall in the reflection scale questionnaire, however they disagree a bit with regards towards team-reflection. This is quite interesting, but during the interview we noticed a few very dominant figures in the team and this might be a the reason why the answers vary a bit when regarding team-reflection.

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}
The structure of the focus group was a walk through of the application and an open discussion during the walk through. The session was recorded, in order to analyze the results after hand and also be able to participate actively during the walk through. We had prepared some application-specific questions to ask the participants during the session. These questions consisted of the most relevant app-specific questions from Section 9.1.3 in the MIRROR evaluation toolbox\citep{mirrorevaluation}. These questions were slightly modified to be used as part of the focus group and can be seen in Table: \ref{questiontable}
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
    \hline
    1  & Can PeacefulBanana help you to collect information relevant to reconstructing experiences from work? \\ \hline
    2  & Can the application help you to reflect on experiences from work?                                    \\ \hline
    3  & Can the application help you to capture reflection outcomes?                                         \\ \hline
    4  & Does the application help you by making daily reflection notes available for later use?              \\ \hline
    5  & Does the application remind you to reflect on experiences?                                           \\ \hline
    6  & Does the application help you to find relevant experiences from others in your team?                 \\ \hline
    7  & Does the application help you to remember previous experiences and reflections?                      \\ \hline
    8  & Does the application help you to store information regarding work experiences?                       \\ \hline
    9  & Can the application help you to decide if and when to reflect?                                       \\ \hline
    10 & Do the application help you by supporting the sharing of experiences?                                \\ \hline
    11 & Does the application guide you on how to share experiences with others?                              \\ \hline
    12 & Can the application improve your collaboration?                                                      \\ \hline
    13 & Does the application provide relevant content for reflection?                                        \\ \hline
    14 & Did the application guide you through the reflection process?                                        \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}

After a brief presentation on the application itself and our goal for this thesis, the walk through started. The goal of the evaluation was primarily to see how an agile development team could integrate our tool into their daily routine. The application was evaluated with test-data, so participants could easily see how it would function in a daily work environment. After showcasing the different features, the researchers facilitated the focus group discussion on how the application could promote reflection for the team, but and also potential shortcomings or challenges to integrating it in their daily routine. The questions asked during the focus group were largely open-ended, which allowed participants freedom to express their views on the application\citep{yin2008case}. The focus group was conducted in a responsive manner, allowing us to follow up on issues uncovered mid-session and adjust the content of the focus group based on this\citep{rubin2011qualitative, wengraf2001qualitative}.

While one researcher facilitated the session, another observed and took notes, with timestamps of important parts. We swapped roles during the session, in order to prevent any variance in the notes and questioning. Any ambiguity was clarified with the participant before moving on. In order to aid analysis, the focus group was recorded and transcribed, before being analyzed. 

\subsection{Why they did not use it?}
The group was intended to test use the system over a period of time, but expressed that the stress level they where under during the test period and the amount of work they had remaining made them focus on that rather than testing the tool for us. They also expressed that since the tool was made available to them so late in the process and the fact that they already had a routine worked in, they therefore forgot to include the tool in that routine on a day to day basis. The fact that they only worked a couple of days a week, which was a bit of an surprise to us as we where expecting them to work almost full-time on the project.

\subsection{If they would have used it}
When discussing tags, the group stated that they felt this might become 'off topic' and that team-members could use tags not relevant at all. This would the corrupt the tag clouds since 'off topic' tags would gain magnitude since people could use the same tags for what ever they commit ed, but when tagging issues f.ex. However one of the members expressed that he would have liked the possibility to tag an entire commit with a theme like [GUI] or [BACKBONE], the other members felt like this would been a great addition to the existing possibilities with tags. This would then add the possibility to categories the tags in to different part of the project and we feel that this could add another dimension to the tool and help the team to see more relevance in the tags, however we feel that the themes should be decide at project-/iteration-start or at least to scaffold the themes some. This implies that the group answered yes to question 2, 3 and 8 in table \ref{questiontable} with the addendum described above which would improve the feature.

The group got had a few pointers regarding the tag cloud as well, even though the felt that it would give a good representation they felt that in order for the users to see the the relationship between the teams tag cloud and their own, tags needed to be placed at the same place and be in the same color for comparison. In the demonstration the tags where neither placed in the same place nor in the same color. It was also debated whether or not it would make any difference to weight tags based on the amount of work behind the commit, but we all agreed that this could be a feature that could be implemented later. Some of the group members pointed out that even only one line changed could be just as important than an entire class. 

While doing their retrospectives, they struggled to remember what they have done the week before and when discussing daily reflection notes. They felt like this would give them an new dimension to ordinary retrospectives whit the possibility to generate questions, however they had some comments on how to possibly improve the feature. By adding a text field where the user could explain what he had done that day it might enhance the level of reflection. This was something they felt was missing from project-management tools like Trello\footnote{\url{http://www.trello.com}} as they where using. When we introduced the group to the feature we call workshop preparation we where overwhelmed by the response, but they felt it could have been even better if it would have included the total tag cloud for the period selected. This gave them a possibility to reconstruct experiences recorded earlier and thus answering the question 1, 7 and 13 in table \ref{questiontable}.

As the group got closer and closer to their final evaluation they experienced that their retrospectives got shorter and shorter, it also lacked structure. When discussing the workshop-feature some of the group members commented that this could be great for a project manager that does not spend that much time with the code hands-on and in general a great tool for retrospectives, but since they had not tested the tool their was no way for them to verify it. This suggests that the group are positive to question 14 in table \ref{questiontable}.

\subsection{Comments}
%Generelle kommentarer gruppen hadde til appen
The group had some comments / suggestions on how to improve the prototype, there was one of the suggestions that we felt was essential to improve the daily reflection note feature. Instead of having the note non editable and only one each day, they suggested that we gave the users the possibility to edit the note all day and at the end of the day it will be locked so that the user can not edit it any more. This suggestion would give the user the option of noting all day long, but they will miss the feature of reflection on the days work at the end of the day as the feature was designed to do. They also suggested that the summary\footnote{With a impact cake-diagram and your own tag cloud.} should include a team tag cloud and the commits done by the user for that day.

They felt like the current notification with the daily reflection note was not enough to grab their attention and should possibly be more dominating on the site so that it was impossible to miss. This indicates that the group slightly disagreed to the question 5 in table \ref{questiontable} as they wanted the reminder to be more dominant and impossible to avoid.

It was also suggested that the group could have a meeting where they planed themes and tags for that iteration so that the tool would become more 'scrum-friendly' as they put it, when it comes to project-management. We feel that this might ensure that users visit the tool more opposite 

One of the group members said that it would be interesting to see if there is a connection on what the users are working on when they are in a bad mood, for example if a user is always unhappy when working on the GUI he should probably not work more on that part of the project.


\section{Discussion}
In this section we will discuss the results and experiences gathered during the usability test, expert review and focus group evaluation of the PeacefulBanana application. We will discuss this in regard of our research questions PeacefulBanana were intended to answer. We will answer all the sub research questions first, since these are more specific by trying to answer parts of the main research question. Finally we will summarize the discussion by answering the main research question, since this is the most general in terms of reflection and learning from experiences.

\begin{center}
How to scaffold collection of data in order to promote reflection?

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 
Sub research question 1 was aimed at answering how the data collected from GitHub by the PeacefulBanana application could be scaffolded in order to promote reflection. 
In order to answer this question we chose to be selective in what data we collected from GitHub. By carefully examining what GitHub offers by itself, we could identify what they didn't offer and retrieve this data if it was relevant to promoting reflection. \\
The first thing we implemented was the repository overview, where users can retrieve their projects milestones and relating issues in order to quickly get up to speed on what has happened since their last visit. The challenge was not only to identify what data to collect, but also scaffold the collected data and present them to the users in a way that triggers reflection. The mood-graph is an example of how we collect each team user's mood each day, and represents it in a graph. This representation allows for a quick and easy mood comparison, which may encourage user's to look into why their mood differs opposed to the team's in a certain period of time.
