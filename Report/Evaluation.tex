\chapter{Evaluation}
In this chapter we will describe how we evaluated the PeacefulBanana tool, and how it fulfills the requirements.

% This chapter evaluates your prototype and how it fulfills the
% stated requirements. Depending on the focus and on available resources
% the evaluation might involve users. If you do not have resources for a user
% evaluation, you can have a scenario that helps illustrate how the prototype
% fulfills the requirements and discuss limitations.

%Evaluate results from expert review. % Do we have any expert reviews?

\section{Focus group}
The prototype was evaluated with a focus group consisting of 8 NTNU students, working together in a group in the IT2901 bachelor - project. The group were using scrum as their agile project methodic, and have also used it previously in development projects. A group of 8 is fairly big, although larger focus groups are recommended in order to collect more commentaries and details from discussions\cite{morgan1998planning}. Participants in the focus group were familiar with the use of GitHub and were also using GitHub for their project at the time of evaluation. In their project they use retrospectives after each sprint, since they are using scrum. This provides the focus group with participants eager to improve their collaboration in agile teams and to improve reflection, both individually and in teams during retrospective sessions. The focus group was hosted at NTNU, in a private workshop lab. 

The group were given the reflection scale from the MIRROR evaluation toolbox before starting the evaluation. Their answers and relationship to reflection can be seen in table \ref{to reflection scale}.

The second scenario is only available for testing by teams of at least 3 people.

Evaluation:
Core questions described in the toolbox, 9.1:
Demographic questions, usage of the app, most relevant app-specific questions - choosing the questions that are most important to our thesis. 
In addition we will use the reflection scale, shown in 9.1.4 both before and after the evaluation period, in order to measure the effect on the tendency to reflect on past
experiences. Finally we will include the learning outcomes questions and the work behaviour questions, after the evaluation period. 

Evaluation proposal with the students in IT2901: 
Students that accept to evaluate our tool, will use it for two weeks, with daily individual use and as a team after the two week period. This will allow us to measure the
usage of both scenario 1 and scenario 2.

Requirements:
The first scenario does not require anything but a github repository and is doable both for single and for multiples in teams.

For scenario 2 we will require a team of at least 3 people in order to collect enough data. 

We have continuously been using and evaluating the tool ourselves, also Trond-Kjetil has been using it for a couple of weeks, so we have some additional evaluation
data also.

\section{Testing}
\subsubsection{Dogfooding}
While developing the applications all of the developers used the application, this is a concept called dogfooding.

Dogfooding is a concept where you 'eat your own dog food', this means that the developers are testing their own produkt while developing it. It is normaly something larger software development teams are doing as a pre alpha-testing, this will help developers to discover eventual problem-areas early.

\subsubsection{User interface}
When most of the functionality was finished an expert review of the user interface was conducted.

Explain how we conducted the test.

During the first set of testing it was revealed a set of inconsistencies, mainly regarding where the users could find certain data and where they though it was natural to find them. 
This resulted in a redesign of certain aspects of the application, where data representation was moved after the second series of test subjects confirmed that they where placed unnatural.
