\section{Focus Group}
Focus groups is a form of qualitative research which can be compared to semi-structured group interviews\citep{rogers2011interaction}. Participants in a group are asked about their opinions and views towards a product or concept based on their background and experiences\citep{krueger2008focus}. The group should consist of six to ten persons, where participants are not inhibited to present their honest opinions and experiences\citep{krueger2008focus}. The discussion is governed by a facilitator which have the task of keeping focus on the discussion in order to get answers to the questions that have been prepared beforehand\citep{krueger2008focus, nielsen1997use}. The facilitator is responsible for keeping the discussion open, uninhibited, non-judgmental and also making sure that all participants are allowed to present their views\citep{powell1996focus}. 

A focus group usually lasts between 90 and 120 minutes, and is conducted in a neutral place. Limitations of a focus group include that you only get information on what potential users say, and not what they do or if it aligns with the reality\citep{nielsen1997use}. Another limitation is that users often think they need something else than what they really need. Therefore it is important to demonstrate something concrete, where users understand fully what the application is, what it does and what it achieves. 
The theory above and the guide proposed by \citet{FocusGrpGuide} provided us with a basis on how to conduct a focus group interview. We gave the participants a smooth and snappy introduction to the agenda of the interview.

\subsection{Focus group context}
The application was evaluated with a focus group consisting of 8 NTNU students, working together in a group in the IT2901 bachelor - project. The group were using scrum as their agile project methodology, and have also used it previously in development projects. A group of 8 is fairly big, although larger focus groups are recommended in order to collect more commentaries and details from discussions\citep{morgan1998planning}. Participants in the focus group were familiar with the use of GitHub and were also using GitHub for their project at the time of evaluation. In their project they use retrospectives after each sprint, since they are using scrum. This provides the focus group with participants eager to improve their collaboration in agile teams and to improve reflection, both individually and in teams during retrospective sessions. The focus group was hosted at NTNU, in a private workshop lab with a circular table.  

The group were given the reflection scale from the MIRROR evaluation toolbox before starting the evaluation. Their answers and relationship to reflection can be seen in table \ref{reflectionscaleresults}. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{reflectionscaleresults}
\caption{Reflection scale results}
\label{reflectionscaleresults}
\end{figure}
The group generally agree with the importance of reflection overall in the reflection scale questionnaire, however they disagree a bit in regards to team-reflection. This is quite interesting, but during the interview we noticed a few very dominant figures in the team and this might be the reason why the answers vary a bit regarding team-reflection.

\subsection{Ground Rules}
In the introduction we identified a set of ground-rules that would make the interview go smoother and keep the participants distraction free. Most of these are based on the ground rules defined in \citet{FocusGrpGuide}, and can be seen in the list below.

\begin{enumerate}
\label{groundrulestest}
\item Mobile phones are to be turned off during the entire interview. If you are not able to do so and receive a call ,please do this as quietly as possible.
\item We are recording the session on tape, so only one person should speak at a time.
\item There is no right or wrong answer here, only opinions.
\item You do not need to agree with others, but you must listen respectfully as others share their views.
\item Talk to each other, not directly to the evaluator.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}
The session was recorded, in order to analyze the results after hand and also to be able to participate actively during the walkthrough. We had prepared some application-specific questions to ask the participants during the session. These questions consisted of the most relevant app-specific questions from Section 9.1.3 in the MIRROR evaluation toolbox \citep{mirrorevaluation}. These questions were slightly modified to be used as part of the focus group and can be seen in Table: \ref{questiontable}
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
    \hline
    1  & Can PeacefulBanana help you to collect information relevant to reconstructing experiences from work? \\ \hline
    2  & Can the application help you to reflect on experiences from work?                                    \\ \hline
    3  & Can the application help you to capture reflection outcomes?                                         \\ \hline
    4  & Does the application help you by making daily reflection notes available for later use?              \\ \hline
    5  & Does the application remind you to reflect on experiences?                                           \\ \hline
    6  & Does the application help you to find relevant experiences from others in your team?                 \\ \hline
    7  & Does the application help you to remember previous experiences and reflections?                      \\ \hline
    8  & Does the application help you to store information regarding work experiences?                       \\ \hline
    9  & Can the application help you to decide if and when to reflect?                                       \\ \hline
    10 & Do the application help you by supporting the sharing of experiences?                                \\ \hline
    11 & Does the application guide you on how to share experiences with others?                              \\ \hline
    12 & Can the application improve your collaboration?                                                      \\ \hline
    13 & Does the application provide relevant content for reflection?                                        \\ \hline
    14 & Did the application guide you through the reflection process?                                        \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{}
    \label{questiontable}
\end{table}

After a brief presentation of the application itself and our goal with this thesis, the walkthrough started. The goal of the evaluation was primarily to see how an agile development team could integrate our tool into their daily routine. The application was evaluated with test-data, so participants could easily see how it would function in a daily work environment. After showcasing the different features, the researchers facilitated the focus group discussion on how the application could promote reflection for the team, but and also potential shortcomings or challenges to integrating it in their daily routine. The questions asked during the focus group were largely open-ended, which allowed participants freedom to express their views on the application\citep{yin2008case}. The focus group was conducted in a responsive manner, allowing us to follow up on issues uncovered mid-session and adjust the content of the focus group based on this\citep{rubin2011qualitative, wengraf2001qualitative}.

While one researcher facilitated the session, another observed and took notes, with timestamps of important parts. We swapped roles during the session, in order to prevent any variance in the notes and questioning. Any ambiguity was clarified with the participant before moving on. In order to aid analysis, the focus group was recorded and transcribed, before being analyzed. The group was also filmed so that their body-language could give us an indication about their involvement in the discussion and it was pointed out by the researchers that the interview would be anonymized to ensure that the statements could not be linked back the them. Quotes from participants are denoted with \emph{FGX}, which stands for \emph{Focus Group user X}. This was done in order to keep participants anonymous. 

\subsection{Why they did not use it?}
The group was intended to participate in a case-study evaluation of the system over a period of time, but expressed that the stress level they where under during the test period and the amount of work they had remaining, made them focus on that rather than testing the tool for us. They also expressed that since the tool was made available for them so late in the process and the fact that they already had a routine worked in, they often forgot to include the tool in their routine on a daily basis. Additionally the group only got together and worked a couple of days a week, was a bit of a surprise to us, as we where expecting them to work almost full-time on the project.

\subsection{If they would have used it}
When discussing \emph{tags}, the group stated that they felt this might become \emph{'off topic'} and that team-members could use tags not relevant to the work at hand. This could in turn corrupt the tag clouds since \emph{'off topic'} tags would gain magnitude if people used the same tags for whatever they commited. One of the participants expressed that he would have liked the possibility to tag an entire commit with a theme like [GUI] or [BACKBONE], which were something the other participants felt would be a great addition to the existing possibilities regarding tags.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Adding categories in brackets or something like that would put the hash tags in perspective too what people are working on and see how much time of their day goes to what part of the project. (FG1)}
\end{quote}
This would allow tags to be categorized into different parts of the project, which we feel could add another dimension to the tool and help the team see more relevance in the tags used. However we feel that the themes or categories should be decided at project-/iteration-start, or at least agree on some rules for what tags can be used on what piece of work. The findings discussed implies that the group answered yes to question 2, 3 and 8 in table \ref{questiontable} with the addendum described above as a possible feature improvement. 

The group also had a few pointers regarding the tag cloud. The group felt tag-clouds was a good representation, the relationship between the team tag-cloud and the individual tag-cloud was not easily identified. They proposed that tags needed to be placed at the same place and be in the same color in the tag-cloud, in order to allow for easier comparison. In the demonstration, the tags were neither placed in the same place or in the same color. 
\begin{quote}
\emph{It is hard to locate the same tags in both of the tag clouds when they are placed in different regions of the cloud and in different colors. (FG2)}
\end{quote}
It was also debated whether or not it would make any difference to weight tags based on the amount of work behind the commit. We all agreed that this could be a feature that could be implemented later. Some of the group members pointed out that even only one line changed could be just as important as an entire class being implemented.
\begin{quote}
\emph{One line to fix a bug, can be as important or even more important than a entire new class. (FG2)}
\end{quote}

The group mentioned that while doing their retrospectives, they struggled to remember what they had done the previous weeks. When discussing daily reflection notes, they stated that this would give them an new dimension to ordinary retrospectives with the possibility to generate questions based on the work that had been done each day. This way, the most important work would be captured each day and easily remembered. The group also had some comments on how to possibly improve the feature: By adding a text field where the user could explain what he had done that day, might enhance the level of reflection. This was something they felt was missing from project-management tools like Trello\footnote{\url{http://www.trello.com}} which they were already using. When we introduced the group to the feature \emph{workshop preparation} we were overwhelmed by the positive response, but they also had some input on how it could be improved. The group stated that we should include the team-wide tag-cloud for the selected period. These features mentioned gave the group the possibility to reconstruct experiences recorded earlier and thus answering questions 1, 7 and 13 in table \ref{questiontable}.

As the group got closer and closer to their final evaluation they experienced that their retrospectives got shorter and shorter, it also lacked structure. This corresponds with the findings described by \citep{kasi2008post} in Section \ref{cha:introduction}. When discussing the workshop-feature some of the group members commented that it could be great for a project manager that does not spend that much time with the code hands-on and in general a great tool for retrospectives, but since they had not tested the tool in they way they conduct work, there was no way for them to verify it. This suggests that the group are positive to question 14 in table \ref{questiontable}.

\begin{quote}
\emph{I would imagine that this would be very useful for a project manager that does spend all day hands-on with coding. (FG1)}
\end{quote}
\subsection{Comments}
The group had some comments and suggestions on how to improve the prototype. As for the daily reflection note feature, a suggestion was that instead of having the note non-editable and allow for only one note each day, users could edit the note whenever they wanted during the day and at the end of it, the note will be locked for user editing. This suggestion would give the user the option of adding to a note all day long. The downside of the change would be that the freshness of the reflection would be mitigated. When the reflection on that days experiences have taken place, allowing users to go back and change their input would take some of the value out of the reflection. The group suggested that the daily reflection note should also include a team tag-cloud, in addition to the commit impact cake-diagram and the individual tag-cloud.

The group also mentioned that the current notifications were not catching their attention, and suggested they be should be more dominating on the site, making the notifications impossible to miss. As they stated: 
\begin{quote}
\emph{As notifications are there to remind users to do their daily reflection, missing the notification might lead to missing the daily reflection also.}
\end{quote}
And:
\begin{quote}
\emph{The current notification is not invasive enough, it should be impossible to ignore. (FG3)}
\end{quote}
This indicates that the group slightly disagreed to question 5 in Table \ref{questiontable}, as they wanted the reminder to be more dominant and impossible to avoid.

It was also suggested that the group could have a meeting where they planned themes and tags to be used for the next iteration, in order to make the tool more \emph{scrum specific}, as they put it, in terms of project management. Making the tool less invasive in the Scrum process is something we feel might ensure that users visit the tool more often, as it's not interfering as much with their daily routine. 

One group member said it would be interesting to see if there is a connection between what the users are working on and their mood. I.e. what are users working on when they are in a bad mood or if a user is always unhappy when working with the graphical design, he should probably not work more on that part of the project.
\begin{quote}
\emph{Seems like a natural and good tool. (FG2)}
\end{quote}

\section{Discussion}
In this section we will discuss the results and experiences gathered during the usability test, expert review and focus group evaluation of the PeacefulBanana application. We will discuss this in regard of our research questions PeacefulBanana were intended to answer. We will answer all the sub research questions first, since these are more specific by trying to answer parts of the main research question. Finally we will summarize the discussion by answering the main research question, since this is the most general in terms of reflection and learning from experiences. 

\subsection{Sub RQ1}
\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 

\begin{center}
    How to scaffold collection of data in order to promote reflection? 
\end{center}

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 
The expert evaluator expressed a concern regarding the amount of data that needed to be processed and that it should not stop the team from being agile, but also pointed out that the feature itself could help during a retrospective session. He also pointed out that the daily reflection note provided the users with a quick and easy way to reflect on a daily basis and that this would work for both users in teams and individuals. However individuals would use the functionality differently than team-users. Team users would also have an effect by looking at the me-vs-team tag-cloud, and he pointed out that this could trigger reflection as well when comparing your own work with the rest of the team.

The focus group pointed out that they might wanted more data showed or at least the possibility to view data in their original form\footnote{Entire commit messages and issues titles in the tag cloud f.ex.} in additions to data we provided for them. They expressed that the use of commit messages to generate questions for retrospectives would give them a another dimension and more structure.

\subsection{Sub RQ2}
\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 

\begin{center}
How to increase the tendency to reflect on experiences, both individually and as a team? \\
\end{center}  

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}}
Regarding the individually reflection the focus group expressed that a reminder in a tool like PeacefulBanana is a good way to trigger reflection, however they felt like the notification was a bit mild and should be more invasive to more force them to reflect over the last the 24 hours of work. Some group members expressed that the fact that the notifications needs to be read and that you can have multiple of them defeats the purpose of the notification, they are not interested in a historic overview of reflection reminders. 

They felt that the tool did not provide them with any reminder in order to improve their reflection rate as a team, however some of them stated that the link only visible to team owner and manager could have some effect in order for them to plan a retrospective session.

\subsection{Sub RQ3}
\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 

\begin{center}
How to bring together contributions from multiple users, and sharing these in a collaborative environment? \\
\end{center}

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}}
The focus group liked that the tool had the possibility to share notes with other team members and that these notes can be inspected. The expert evaluator stated that this was vital for the users to reconstruct work experiences in order for them to reflect over past experiences. The tag-cloud could also be used to identify how much you work on different issues.

The expert reviewer stated that the application introduced some new aspects that changed the normal routine for a retrospective, by generating suggestive questions based on the work done. He then expressed that it would have liked the application to be tested with a real agile software development team over a period of time and then conduct a retrospective session with that team. It would then be interesting to see if the laggers described in Figure \ref{rogerscurve}(Section \ref{subsec:overallfeedback}) would have as much to contribute with as the early adopters.

\subsection{Main RQ}
\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 

\begin{center}
How to promote experienced-based reflection based on project artifacts collected from version-control systems? \\
\end{center}

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 
During the evaluation every step of the PeacefulBanana work-process have been evaluated by the different evaluators and is described in the sections above when discussing the different sub research questions. The first step is collect and is related to collecting data for reflection, here the application gathers data from GitHub. Then the data is analyzed and the tags added by the team members are added to each member and displayed in their daily as well as the overall team cloud of tags. These tags are placed here to remind the user on what the have been working on the last day, during both evaluations it was expressed that this was something the users would benefit greatly from.

The next step in the process is then reflection, here we use the data collected in the step above to trigger reflection when showing the user the me-vs-team tag-cloud. When the user sees the tags he has been working on compared with the rest of the team this can trigger reflection. During the evaluations there where some minor comments regarding placements of the tags, but after discussing it with the focus group we all agreed that this was something that could indeed trigger reflection. The users also have to fill out a daily reflection note and this process is more scaffolded, since the users have to full out a scheme with a set of questions related to their daily activities.

The third step consists of sharing your experiences with team members in order for them to learn from them, here the users can both share their daily reflection notes for the other team members. Or the issues described in them can be discussed in the retrospective reflection session scheduled to take place after each iteration.

The fourth and last step consists of taking the outcomes of your reflection and putting it to use in work related tasks in order to improve.

The evaluators expressed both concerns and appreciation for the use of these data and the fact that the expert reviewer would have liked to see a study with the application is a great sign that the he find the tool useful for agile teams.
