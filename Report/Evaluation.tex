\chapter{Evaluation}
PeacefulB
This chapter evaluates your prototype and how it fulfills the
stated requirements. Depending on the focus and on available resources
the evaluation might involve users. If you do not have resources for a user
evaluation, you can have a scenario that helps illustrate how the prototype
fulfills the requirements and discuss limitations.

The prototype will be evaluated with a group of NTNU students, in the IT2901 bachelor - project. The users will use it for two weeks, in order to accomodate for both scenarios.
