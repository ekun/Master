\chapter{Evaluation}
In this chapter we will describe how we evaluated the PeacefulBanana tool, and how it fulfills the requirements.

% This chapter evaluates your prototype and how it fulfills the
% stated requirements. Depending on the focus and on available resources
% the evaluation might involve users. If you do not have resources for a user
% evaluation, you can have a scenario that helps illustrate how the prototype
% fulfills the requirements and discuss limitations.

%Evaluate results from expert review. % Do we have any expert reviews?

\section{Focus group}
The prototype was evaluated with a focus group consisting of 8 NTNU students, working together in a group in the IT2901 bachelor - project. The group were using scrum as their agile project methodic, and have also used it previously in development projects. A group of 8 is fairly big, although larger focus groups are recommended in order to collect more commentaries and details from discussions\cite{morgan1998planning}. Participants in the focus group were familiar with the use of GitHub and were also using GitHub for their project at the time of evaluation. In their project they use retrospectives after each sprint, since they are using scrum. This provides the focus group with participants eager to improve their collaboration in agile teams and to improve reflection, both individually and in teams during retrospective sessions. The focus group was hosted at NTNU, in a private workshop lab. 

The group were given the reflection scale from the MIRROR evaluation toolbox before starting the evaluation. Their answers and relationship to reflection can be seen in table \ref{mirrormodel}.

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}
The structure of the focus group was a walkthrough of the application and an open discussion during the walkthrough. The session was recorded, in order to analyze the results afterhand and also be able to participate actively during the walkthrough. We had prepared some application-specific questions to ask the participants during the session. These questions consisted of the most relevant app-specific questions from Section 9.1.3 in the MIRROR evaluation toolbox\cite{mirrorevaluation}. These questions were slightly modified to be used as part of a focus group and can be seen in Table: \ref{questiontable}

\section{Testing}
\subsubsection{Dogfooding}
While developing the applications all of the developers used the application, this is a concept called dogfooding.

Dogfooding is a concept where you 'eat your own dog food', this means that the developers are testing their own produkt while developing it. It is normaly something larger software development teams are doing as a pre alpha-testing, this will help developers to discover eventual problem-areas early.

\subsubsection{User interface}
When most of the functionality was finished an expert review of the user interface was conducted.

Explain how we conducted the test.

During the first set of testing it was revealed a set of inconsistencies, mainly regarding where the users could find certain data and where they though it was natural to find them. 
This resulted in a redesign of certain aspects of the application, where data representation was moved after the second series of test subjects confirmed that they where placed unnatural.
