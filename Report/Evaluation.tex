\section{Focus group}
As a basin for the focus group interview we used \citet{FocusGrpGuide} guide on how to conduct a focus group interview. We gave the participants a smooth and snappy introduction to the agenda of the interview.

The application was evaluated with a focus group consisting of 8 NTNU students, working together in a group in the IT2901 bachelor - project. The group were using scrum as their agile project methodology, and have also used it previously in development projects. A group of 8 is fairly big, although larger focus groups are recommended in order to collect more commentaries and details from discussions\citep{morgan1998planning}. Participants in the focus group were familiar with the use of GitHub and were also using GitHub for their project at the time of evaluation. In their project they use retrospectives after each sprint, since they are using scrum. This provides the focus group with participants eager to improve their collaboration in agile teams and to improve reflection, both individually and in teams during retrospective sessions. The focus group was hosted at NTNU, in a private workshop lab with a circular table.  

The group were given the reflection scale from the MIRROR evaluation toolbox before starting the evaluation. Their answers and relationship to reflection can be seen in table \ref{reflectionscaleresults}.

\end{figure}
In the table above we can see the level of agreement represented by the amount of group members which answered what for each of the questions. The group generally agree with the importance of reflection overall in the reflection scale questionnaire, however they disagree a bit with regards towards team-reflection. This is quite interesting, but during the interview we noticed a few very dominant figures in the team and this might be a the reason why the answers vary a bit when regarding team-reflection.

\subsection{Ground Rules}
In the introduction we set down a set of ground-rules that would make the interview go smoother and keep the participants distraction free. Most of these are based on the ground rules defined in \citet{FocusGrpGuide}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Mobile phones where to be turned off during the entire interview, if you are not able to do so and receive a call. Please do this as quietly as possible.
\item We're tape recording, one person speaking at a time.
\item There is no right or wrong answer here, only opinions.
\item You don't need to agree with others, but you must listen respectfully as others share their views.
\item Talk to each other.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}
The session was recorded, in order to analyze the results after hand and also be able to participate actively during the walk through. We had prepared some application-specific questions to ask the participants during the session. These questions consisted of the most relevant app-specific questions from Section 9.1.3 in the MIRROR evaluation toolbox\citep{mirrorevaluation}. These questions were slightly modified to be used as part of the focus group and can be seen in Table: \ref{questiontable}
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
    \hline
    1  & Can PeacefulBanana help you to collect information relevant to reconstructing experiences from work? \\ \hline
    2  & Can the application help you to reflect on experiences from work?                                    \\ \hline
    3  & Can the application help you to capture reflection outcomes?                                         \\ \hline
    4  & Does the application help you by making daily reflection notes available for later use?              \\ \hline
    5  & Does the application remind you to reflect on experiences?                                           \\ \hline
    6  & Does the application help you to find relevant experiences from others in your team?                 \\ \hline
    7  & Does the application help you to remember previous experiences and reflections?                      \\ \hline
    8  & Does the application help you to store information regarding work experiences?                       \\ \hline
    9  & Can the application help you to decide if and when to reflect?                                       \\ \hline
    10 & Do the application help you by supporting the sharing of experiences?                                \\ \hline
    11 & Does the application guide you on how to share experiences with others?                              \\ \hline
    12 & Can the application improve your collaboration?                                                      \\ \hline
    13 & Does the application provide relevant content for reflection?                                        \\ \hline
    14 & Did the application guide you through the reflection process?                                        \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{}
    \label{questiontable}
\end{table}

After a brief presentation on the application itself and our goal for this thesis, the walk through started. The goal of the evaluation was primarily to see how an agile development team could integrate our tool into their daily routine. The application was evaluated with test-data, so participants could easily see how it would function in a daily work environment. After showcasing the different features, the researchers facilitated the focus group discussion on how the application could promote reflection for the team, but and also potential shortcomings or challenges to integrating it in their daily routine. The questions asked during the focus group were largely open-ended, which allowed participants freedom to express their views on the application\citep{yin2008case}. The focus group was conducted in a responsive manner, allowing us to follow up on issues uncovered mid-session and adjust the content of the focus group based on this\citep{rubin2011qualitative, wengraf2001qualitative}.

While one researcher facilitated the session, another observed and took notes, with timestamps of important parts. We swapped roles during the session, in order to prevent any variance in the notes and questioning. Any ambiguity was clarified with the participant before moving on. In order to aid analysis, the focus group was recorded and transcribed, before being analyzed. The group was also filmed so that their body-language could give us an indication about their involvement in the discussion and it was pointed out by the researchers that the interview would be anonymized to ensure that the statements could not be linked back the them.

\subsection{Why they did not use it?}
The group was intended to test use the system over a period of time, but expressed that the stress level they where under during the test period and the amount of work they had remaining made them focus on that rather than testing the tool for us. They also expressed that since the tool was made available to them so late in the process and the fact that they already had a routine worked in, they therefore forgot to include the tool in that routine on a day to day basis. The fact that they only worked a couple of days a week, which was a bit of an surprise to us as we where expecting them to work almost full-time on the project.

\subsection{If they would have used it}
When discussing tags, the group stated that they felt this might become 'off topic' and that team-members could use tags not relevant at all. This would the corrupt the tag clouds since 'off topic' tags would gain magnitude since people could use the same tags for what ever they commit ed, but when tagging issues f.ex. However one of the members expressed that he would have liked the possibility to tag an entire commit with a theme like [GUI] or [BACKBONE], the other members felt like this would been a great addition to the existing possibilities with tags.
\begin{quote}
Adding categories in brackets or something like that would put the hash tags in perspective too what people are working on and see how much time of their day goes to what part of the project. (FG1)
\end{quote}
This would then add the possibility to categories the tags in to different part of the project and we feel that this could add another dimension to the tool and help the team to see more relevance in the tags, however we feel that the themes should be decide at project-/iteration-start or at least to scaffold the themes some. This implies that the group answered yes to question 2, 3 and 8 in table \ref{questiontable} with the addendum described above which would improve the feature.

The group got had a few pointers regarding the tag cloud as well, even though the felt that it would give a good representation they felt that in order for the users to see the the relationship between the teams tag cloud and their own, tags needed to be placed at the same place and be in the same color for comparison. In the demonstration the tags where neither placed in the same place nor in the same color. 
\begin{quote}
    It is hard to locate the same tags in both of the tag clouds when they are placed in different regions of the cloud and in different color. (FG2)
\end{quote}
It was also debated whether or not it would make any difference to weight tags based on the amount of work behind the commit, but we all agreed that this could be a feature that could be implemented later. Some of the group members pointed out that even only one line changed could be just as important than an entire class.
\begin{quote}
    One line to fix a bug, can be as important or even more important than a entire new class. (FG2)
\end{quote}

They mentioned that while doing their retrospectives, they struggled to remember what they have done the week before and when discussing daily reflection notes. They felt like this would give them an new dimension to ordinary retrospectives whit the possibility to generate questions, however they had some comments on how to possibly improve the feature. By adding a text field where the user could explain what he had done that day it might enhance the level of reflection. This was something they felt was missing from project-management tools like Trello\footnote{\url{http://www.trello.com}} as they where using. When we introduced the group to the feature we call workshop preparation we where overwhelmed by the response, but they felt it could have been even better if it would have included the total tag cloud for the period selected. This gave them a possibility to reconstruct experiences recorded earlier and thus answering the question 1, 7 and 13 in table \ref{questiontable}.

As the group got closer and closer to their final evaluation they experienced that their retrospectives got shorter and shorter, it also lacked structure. When discussing the workshop-feature some of the group members commented that this could be great for a project manager that does not spend that much time with the code hands-on and in general a great tool for retrospectives, but since they had not tested the tool their was no way for them to verify it. This suggests that the group are positive to question 14 in table \ref{questiontable}.

\subsection{Comments}
%Generelle kommentarer gruppen hadde til appen
The group had some comments / suggestions on how to improve the prototype, there was one of the suggestions that we felt was essential to improve the daily reflection note feature. Instead of having the note non editable and only one each day, they suggested that we gave the users the possibility to edit the note all day and at the end of the day it will be locked so that the user can not edit it any more. This suggestion would give the user the option of noting all day long, but they will miss the feature of reflection on the days work at the end of the day as the feature was designed to do. They also suggested that the summary\footnote{With a impact cake-diagram and your own tag cloud.} should include a team tag cloud and the commits done by the user for that day.

They felt like the current notification with the daily reflection note was not enough to grab their attention and should possibly be more dominating on the site so that it was impossible to miss. This indicates that the group slightly disagreed to the question 5 in table \ref{questiontable} as they wanted the reminder to be more dominant and impossible to avoid.
\begin{quote}
The current notification is not invasive enough, it should not be possible to avoid. (FG3)
\end{quote}

It was also suggested that the group could have a meeting where they planed themes and tags for that iteration so that the tool would become more 'scrum-friendly' as they put it, when it comes to project-management. We feel that this might ensure that users visit the tool more opposite 

One of the group members said that it would be interesting to see if there is a connection on what the users are working on when they are in a bad mood, for example if a user is always unhappy when working on the GUI he should probably not work more on that part of the project.

\begin{quote}
Seems like a natural and good tool. (FG2)
\end{quote}

They also envisioned another way of using the tool as well.
\begin{quote}
I would imagine that this would be very useful for a project manager that does spend all day hands-on with coding. (FG1)
\end{quote}


\section{Discussion}
In this section we will discuss the results and experiences gathered during the usability test, expert review and focus group evaluation of the PeacefulBanana application. We will discuss this in regard of our research questions PeacefulBanana were intended to answer. We will answer all the sub research questions first, since these are more specific by trying to answer parts of the main research question. Finally we will summarize the discussion by answering the main research question, since this is the most general in terms of reflection and learning from experiences. 

\subsection{Sub RQ1}
\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 

\begin{center}
    How to scaffold collection of data in order to promote reflection? 
\end{center}

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 
The expert evaluator expressed a concern regarding the amount of data that needed to be processed and that it should not stop the team from being agile, but also pointed out that the feature itself could help during a retrospective session. He also pointed out that the daily reflection note provided the users with a quick and easy way to reflect on a daily basis and that this would work for both users in teams and individuals. However individuals would use the functionality differently than team-users.

The focus group pointed out that they might wanted more data showed or at least the possibility to view data in their original form\footnote{Entire commit messages and issues titles in the tag cloud f.ex.} in additions to data we provided for them. They expressed that the use of commit messages to generate questions for retrospectives would give them a another dimension and more structure.

\subsection{Sub RQ2}
\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 

\begin{center}
How to increase the tendency to reflect on experiences, both individually and as a team? \\
\end{center}  

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}}
Regarding the individually reflection the focus group expressed that a reminder in a tool like PeacefulBanana is a good way to trigger reflection, however they felt like the notification was a bit mild and should be more invasive to more force them to reflect over the last the 24 hours of work. Some group members expressed that the fact that the notifications needs to be read and that you can have multiple of them defeats the purpose of the notification, they are not interested in a historic overview of reflection reminders. 

They felt that the tool did not provide them with any reminder in order to improve their reflection rate as a team, however some of them stated that the link only visible to team owner and manager could have some effect in order for them to plan a retrospective session.

\subsection{Sub RQ3}
\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 

\begin{center}
How to bring together contributions from multiple users? \\
\end{center}

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}}
The focus group liked that the tool had the possibility to share notes with other team members and that these notes can be inspected. The expert evaluator stated that this was vital for the users to reconstruct work experiences in order for them to reflect over past experiences. The tag-cloud could also be used to identify how much you work on different issues.

\begin{center}
How to promote experienced-based learning from reflection based on project artifacts collected from version-control systems \\
\end{center}

\noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}} 
As discovered by the evaluation the tool gives the users the possibility to reflect over artifacts gathered from version control systems and it is shown that the evaluators find these features useful.
