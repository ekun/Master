\chapter{Evaluation}
In this chapter we will describe how we evaluated the PeacefulBanana tool, and how it fulfills the requirements.

% This chapter evaluates your prototype and how it fulfills the
% stated requirements. Depending on the focus and on available resources
% the evaluation might involve users. If you do not have resources for a user
% evaluation, you can have a scenario that helps illustrate how the prototype
% fulfills the requirements and discuss limitations.


\section{Usability}
Evaluate the results of the usability testing. 

\section{Expert Review}
Evaluate results from expert review. % Birgit and who else?

\section{Interview}
Interview a set of 'real' developers.

\section{Case Study}
The prototype will be evaluated with a group of NTNU students, in the IT2901 bachelor - project. They will use it for a minimum of two weeks, in order to accomodate for both scenarios.

The second scenario is only available for testing by teams of at least 3 people.

Evaluation:
Core questions described in the toolbox, 9.1:
Demographic questions, usage of the app, most relevant app-specific questions - choosing the questions that are most important to our thesis. 
In addition we will use the reflection scale, shown in 9.1.4 both before and after the evaluation period, in order to measure the effect on the tendency to reflect on past
experiences. Finally we will include the learning outcomes questions and the work behaviour questions, after the evaluation period. 

Evaluation proposal with the students in IT2901: 
Students that accept to evaluate our tool, will use it for two weeks, with daily individual use and as a team after the two week period. This will allow us to measure the
usage of both scenario 1 and scenario 2.

Requirements:
The first scenario does not require anything but a github repository and is doable both for single and for multiples in teams.

For scenario 2 we will require a team of at least 3 people in order to collect enough data. 

We have continuously been using and evaluating the tool ourselves, also Trond-Kjetil has been using it for a couple of weeks, so we have some additional evaluation
data also.
