# Evaluation:
Core questions described in the toolbox, 9.1:
Demographic questions, usage of the app, most relevant app-specific questions - choosing the questions that are most important to our thesis. 
In addition we will use the reflection scale, shown in 9.1.4 both before and after the evaluation period, in order to measure the effect on the tendency to reflect on past
experiences. Finally we will include the learning outcomes questions and the work behaviour questions, after the evaluation period. 

## Evaluation with the students in IT2901: 
Students will use the tool for two weeks, daily individual use and as a team after the two week period. 
For scenario 2 we will require a team of at least 3 people in order to test. 
The first scenario does not require anything but a github repository. 

# Stuff:
Har skrevet om PeacefulBanana kapitlet, dette er nå generelt for versjonkontroll systemer og nevner ikke Github. På denne måten vil background kapitlet introdusere teorier som agile, mirror modellen og refleksjon/refleksjonsmodellen. Problem elaboration vil så definere problemet hvor Github blir introdusert som en mulig løsning på spørsmålet vårt(VCS må innføres i et research question vil jeg tro.). Da er det bare å gunne på :D

# Notater / Feedback fra 14.03 
* ~~Is our focus software development in general or a project based course?~~
* Description of the rationale -> Could be done connecting functionalities to the MIRROR model and a clear connection to agile development.
* ~~Decide whether the thesis should introduce github in the research question and build on it, or if it should be general and introduce github as an example. ~~
* Introduce GitHub in the Problem elaboration chapter before scenarios. 

## Research Question
Reformulate questions so we can get feedback on the tool and the evaluation we are planning. 

## PeacefulBanana
This chapter should be very high-level, a simple overview of what the application does. Should only contain information on what it does exactly, and not why and how. Some of the data here should be moved to implementation. F.ex functionality chapters should be moved to implementation. 

## Background
Create a background chapter where agile software development is introduced, and the MIRROR model + Birgits model,since these should come early on. Then we can build the problem elaboration on this.

## Problem elaboration
This should build on the background above, so it is clear and natural where the scenarios come from, and why we chose these scenarios(how representative they are).   
Also be aware of the level of detail in this chapter. The objective of the chapter is to describe high level requirements. What purpose does the scenario serve?   

## State of the art
* ~~Move literature review here~~
* Should refer more directly to tools & support of software development and reflection(related work)

## Requirements
The user stories here mention f.ex github which havent been discussed above. Either github needs to be introduced, or change them to a general version-control system. This is a choice we need to make, is github just an example of an implementation, or do we build the RQ on Github and the data Github provides(f.ex do other tracking systems have milestones & issues in the same way?). 

## Implementation
Missing an overview of the general architecture.   
Move the Github introduction/details to come earlier, perhaps in problem elaboration or even earlier, since it is not really an implementation choice. 

## Quick start
Why is it important to improve reflection in teams?  
Make the student presentation more task-oriented(storyboard), instead of a pure user-manual  
Design choices should be explained in design also.
