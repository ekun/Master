## TODO + feedback fra monica fra 05.11:
~~Dropbox folder to share report and documents with Monica: Check</strike~~

### General

* Add Tracking table to report
* Better contextualization of the work in state of the art and ,ore systematic analysis of the problem and rationale of the design
* Add analysis of the scenarios that provides some highlevel challenges to support reflection in our specific context. 
* Specify whether our tool is general and evaluated in IT2901 or developed specific for IT2901! 
* Further specify a timetable. What should be done and when.  

### Research Method
Where are we getting requirements from?  
What will guide our design?  
How will we evaluate the tool?  

### Scenarios
Scenarios need to be more grounded.  
Before we start with the scenarios themselves we should provide some context.  
Scenario 3 is the less relevant one, as it focuses on individual aspects, and we are mainly interested in collaboration.  
This could be made more relevant if we focus it on "MY work vs the TEAM" .  
Also add another scenario on reflection across teams, f.ex how to learn from different projects. 

#### Introduction
Briefly talk about reflection and software development in the introduction. 

#### Problem elaboration
Explain more about agile methods, why reflection is important, what are the challenges etc. Then we can discuss the scenarios.  
Important to build an argumentation that justifies our focus, and since we develop a tool for use with github, our discussion should focus on the role of the artifact in the process(and the collaboration around it). This bart should be based on literature on agile software development and reflection. 

### MIRROR reflection model
What role do we see fpr the Computer-supported reflection model of MIRROR? Make use of the different phases of work/reflection and consider the support that can be provided in each step.  
Model can be found: http://www.mirror-project.eu/showroom-a-publications/deliverables/174-d14model  
Using the model should make it easier to further specify the scenarios. 

### Related work

* Start with some of the papers from Birgit. Also her PhD: http://www.idi.ntnu.no/research/doctor_theses/birgitkr.pdf  
* Focus should be on tools for reflection in software development
* Birgits overview in her thesis should be expanded and updated. Important to work on related work so that we know we develop something innovative.  

### How to use the data when not on a computer/web?
Work is mainly done on the computer, reflection however is often done without a screen in small workshops. What challenges are there to making the data available in a suitable form? - Focus on reflection use not on everyday use. Tailor the webapp to be used in these workshops, and/or collect data from the tool for this use.
